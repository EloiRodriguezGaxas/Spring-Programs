# Spring-Programs
Some programs code with spring 

Here you will find:

1. An example of an api rest with security which also gets the repositories from your personal github and can create notes directly to your gists. This is the github-oauth project 

2. An example of a working program with microservices, the different services have been dismantled into different and independent programs, which uses the suul proxy and also the RabbitMQ so the services can talk using the spring cloud.
